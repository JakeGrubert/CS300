# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We were tasked with developing a program designed to generate a sample schedule and provide course details for a college advising team.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures pervade our surroundings often unnoticed. Inserting information into a data structure is considerably simpler than crafting redundant and repetitive code. The runtime for utilizing data structures is significantly lower compared to alternative methods.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Experimentation and receiving guidance were instrumental in the success of this project. On several occasions, I found myself grappling with problems without a clear solution, and tutoring provided the assistance necessary to overcome those challenges.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has pushed me to reconsider my approach to interpreting and creating programs. The algorithms we've acquired prove highly beneficial in the development of a program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Undoubtedly, this project stands out as the most demanding one I've undertaken. It has repeatedly tested my patience. Crafting programs that are adaptable, maintainable, and readable is crucial in any coding environment. This project, along with the entire course, has consistently compelled me to enhance these qualities with each assignment.
